<p>“W-wait a bit! Why are things suddenly turning out like that?!&#8221; Ayane stood up in front of me and asked out loud.</p>



<p>It was lunchtime in the cafeteria of Meisei University.</p>



<p>There were many other students around us.</p>



<p>Naturally, Ayane was the focus of all their attention.</p>



<p>&#8220;C-calm down, Ayane. What&#8217;s the matter? It&#8217;s nothing to get flustered about, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? Ah, yeah. That&#8217;s right&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayane sat there with a slightly gloomy face.</p>



<p>The three of us gathered in the cafeteria for lunch as usual, and I told them the whole story of what happened yesterday.</p>



<p>The moment I finished, Ayane suddenly stood up.</p>



<p>Seiji, who was watching next to her, muttered, &#8220;Now it&#8217;s getting interesting&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eita, just to confirm&#8230; Was it that beautiful girl, Asuka? And she brought a cake to Eita&#8217;s apartment yesterday?&#8221; Ayane asked me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah. Yeah, cheesecake.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what it was. It rained so hard that the girl got soaked.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So Eita took her into his apartment and made her take a shower.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why do you say&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, you can&#8217;t let a girl do that, can you? She&#8217;s not even your girlfriend!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, but you know what? If I hadn&#8217;t done that, she would have caught a cold for sure.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, I know, but! Couldn&#8217;t she just give the cake to you and hurry home?&#8221; Ayane said and took a sip of tea from a plastic teacup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to go to my next class.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayane then took the tray of lunch she had eaten and quickly left.</p>



<p>It should still be early in the day for her next class&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s really going on? Ayane doesn’t seem like her usual self.”</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, man, I want to punch this guy.”</p>



<p>&#8220;What?”</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing. Well, good luck!&#8221;</p>



<p>He said, standing up with his tray and tapping me on the shoulder.</p>



<p>====</p>



<p>&#8220;Haaah, I&#8217;ve been caught off guard&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>I arrived early at the large classroom for the next class and sighed loudly.</p>



<p>It even feels a bit like a joke for me.</p>



<p>The moment you fall in love with someone, you can&#8217;t control it.</p>



<p>To be honest, I&#8217;ve been pretty popular since high school.</p>



<p>Not only my looks but also my unnecessarily heavy chest seemed to be attractive to boys.</p>



<p>Even after I entered university, I was still approached by many boys.</p>



<p>On the surface, I&#8217;m friendly with everyone, boys and girls alike.</p>



<p>However&#8230; I sensed a strange ulterior motive from most of the boys.</p>



<p>Trying to get me to drink alcohol when I am underage or lure me out to be alone with me.</p>



<p>I hated it.</p>



<p>If it had been a boy I liked, it might have been another story, but Eita was different.</p>



<p>Now that I remember&#8230; It was just this classroom.</p>



<p>On the surface, I was trying to appear amicable. Yet, in my heart, I had put up a thin barrier between me and others.</p>



<p>Even in this large classroom, I sat alone.</p>



<p>I was listening to the lecture earnestly when I dropped my ballpoint pen trying to get an eraser from my pen case.</p>



<p>The boy next to me, who had taken up one of the seats, picked it up.</p>



<p>ED Note: I feel like this will get interesting.</p>

<p>At the case register of the convenience store, I saved a really cute employee from a blond haired yankee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I didn’t know that I had already saved her once near Kichijouji station. This coincidence was really interesting.</p>



<p>Minamino Asuka-chan.</p>



<p>Now that I look at her again, she really was a beautiful JK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>◆◆◆</p>



<p>I really believe this is fate! Since he saved me not just once, but twice.</p>



<p>Nakadai Eita san.<br>I wasn’t able to stop the ends of my mouth from loosening.</p>



<p>The scene is Tokyo.</p>



<p>This is a lighthearted, coming of age story which unravels when a group of university students from the countryside and some young girls from Tokyo meet.</p>
